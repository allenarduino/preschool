This is an e-learning application for BECE and WASSCE students
The back end is powered by Python3(Flask) and Mysql database
The front end is powered by React ES6
This application is a REST API so you can build and android app in future to 
consume the same data from the backend
It uses JWT method for authentication and authorization instead of session
It uses JWT because it's a REST API
Before running this,you need to install nodejs and python3.

CD into Backend directory and run Python3 app.py
CD into wap in Instructor_Teacher_Frontend directory and run npm start
CD into wap in Student_Frontend directory and run npm start
CD into wap in Admin_Frontend directory and run npm start


Coding is fun :)
